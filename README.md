# phase-1-toy-problems-speed-detector
This programme takes speed of a car as an input and calculates the demerit points using it

Clone the repository and navigate to where you are writing your code from
start by writing a function which calculates demerit points as like the following 
Function describe (speed)
       declare a variable to speed limit and km per point too

       use the if and else statements for the conditions given which are print 'ok' if speed is less than speed limit and 'license suspended' if points is greater than 12



you can test the code using node.js to check the functionality of your code
